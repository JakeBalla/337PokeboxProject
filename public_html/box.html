                <p id="info">Sample Text: It’s early morning, just before the first rays of sunlight begin to peek over the horizon. Praven stands looking out the only window in his room. The night sky above is full of stars, illuminating the quiet streets of Yenth. He is wearing simple clothes, with his dirty blond hair tied in a tail. The stars above reflecting in his jet black eyes. He watches the occasional passerby on the cobbled street underneath getting an early start to their days. It’ll only be a couple of moments before he can begin.
                    It is then that the mist begins to roll in from the East, as large clouds clamber over each other engulfing the streets. It grows taller, and wisps of white start crawling into Praven’s room. It takes only a few seconds for the room to be filled, as the mist now towers above the buildings.
            Praven watches as in the distance, the sun commences its trek across the sky. From one second to the next, the mist that covers the town is ignited, the morning light giving all of Yenth a pink-orange filter. He peers out into the vibrant peach mist in front of him, the streets below now hidden beneath a thick layer of cloud, their existence only betrayed by the faint circles of blue lights that line the walkways. 
        Praven closes his eyes and concentrates. When he opens his eyes, there is a small green ball in front of his face. Nanites, microscopic machines, relics of a civilization that has long since run its course. When Praven was someone else, he had a teacher who had tried to explain their existence to him. Entities too small to see with the naked eye, they connected everything in the world, though no one knows their purpose, or if they had any still. They existed everywhere, even within people. Normally they have no effect on the average person, but every now and again, someone comes along who is capable of communicating with them. Now, most of those lectures lay somewhere, locked deep within someone else’s memory. After all it didn’t matter much to him what or why they were,  he  knew he could make them do things. Tricks of light mostly. He sends out the small green orb up into the sky.
        5 feet.
         His previous record had almost been 30 feet, that had been three weeks ago.
        15 feet. 
            He had been in Yenth for almost three months. It was a calm, a feeling that Praven still had troubles coming to terms with. A small town in the north of the Pytharon Empire, it had been simple enough to get across the border, but that had been what weighed on him the most. The last couple of months had felt too easy. 
        25 feet
            He could leave, maybe head north towards Malevich, maybe Iscobal. He had a nice thing going on in Yenth, though. Nobody knew who he was, he had a job that kept his head above the water, but he still felt too close. 
        His mornings would be spent before the fog looking west, half expecting to see Yenth being put to siege.
        30 feet
            He knew the moment the connection severed. He felt as the orb left his reach, fizzling out into the mist above, as the feedback came rushing back to him. Hitting directly in his brain, it left him dizzy for a couple of seconds. Two months ago a stunt like that would have left him out of commission for the rest of the day. And though the ball had been small, the fact that he remained on his feet was still improvement.
